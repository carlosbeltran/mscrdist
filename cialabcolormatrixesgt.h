 * DESCRIPTION: 
 *   Contains groundtruth cialab color matrices. The matrixes have been
 *   obtained from matlab running the code:
 *  
 *       mser    =   Blobs(i); 
 *       A = permute(mser.pvec, [3,2,1]);
 *       C = applycform(A, reg);
 *       colour = permute(C,[3,2,1]);
 *                       
 *       dataf(i).Mmvec=mser.mvec;
 *       dataf(i).Mpvec=colour;
